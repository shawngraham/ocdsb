# Fall 2014 Student Projects

There were 8 projects submitted this term. The three provided here are exemplarly in terms of the quality of their build, and also the quality of the historical thinking that went on to guide the build.

For evidence of their historical thinking, I took into account not just the paradata documents submitted, but also my observations of their in-class discussions, their interactions on the LMS discussion forum set up for their groups, my observations of their in-world interactions and also in our Underhill Research Room (computer lab) in the history department.

Within each project folder, you will find a zip of their world as well as the unzipped version, and a copy of their paradata document. We invite you to play these worlds, and do feel free to leave us feedback via the github issue tracker.
