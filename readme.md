# No More Essays

The essay is dead. We have killed it. What joy, what experimentation, what it might actually mean 'to try' something - _essayer_ has been hammered out of our lives. Instead, we keep a careful eye on the teacher's expectations, and we end up writing something very _safe_, very _narrow_, very much for an audience of _one_.

> "...the essay form, which should be extremely free and flexible, is instead often presented as a static and rule-bound monster that students must master in order not to lose marks [...] Far from an opportunity to explore intellectual passions and interests in a personal style, the essay is transformed into a formulaic method for discussing set topics in five paragraphs: the [compulsory figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_figures) of academia." (O'Donnell, 2012)

In my presentation, I will argue that we can return to the spirit of the essay if we remember that one of its early purposes was to communicate to a wider public; that it was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are _here_: that is, a simulation. The written essay was an excellent tool for building worlds in other peoples' minds, but I think that is no longer the case.

Daniel Paul O'Donnell calls for ['unessays'](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay). 

> It works by throwing out all the rules you have learned about essay writing in the course of your primary, secondary, and post secondary education and asks you to focus instead solely on your intellectual interests and passions. In an unessay you [choose your own topic](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay#topic), [present it any way you please](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay#style), and are evaluated on [how compelling and effective you are](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay#grading).

A lovely by-product of unessays is that it becomes very difficult for the student to conceive of the work as having an audience of just one, the prof. I tell my students that unessays turn the classroom inside out: for me to judge how compelling and effective the work is, I need to know what _other people_ think about the work. In this way, history ceases to be a chore written for an audience of one, but rather a performance for the wider world. We return to our story-telling social roots, as both teachers and learners.

In this presentation, I will walk you through a number of 'unessays' that I have used in my own teaching at Carleton University, from first year students building 3d models of archaeological artefacts to third year students building worlds to graduate students and beyond writing historical interactive (non)fiction. I have played with augmented reality storytelling, placed-based locative media, and the sonification of historical data. I will explore what has worked particularly well, what hasn't, the challenges and the potentials. There is danger in doing things off-the-beaten track. As a white, middle aged tenured prof, there are things that I can do in the classroom and online that might not be feasible in the context of your own teaching. That said, there are ways of taking aspects of all this to explore with your own students.

ἱστορία

Inquiry.

Watch the youngest children learn, before we have 'schooled them'. There is joy there. There is joy because it is play; it is social. There is no audience of one. 

Stephen Ramsay, of the University of Nebraska Lincoln, calls this ['the screwmeneutical imperative'](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12544152.0001.001/1:5/--pastplay-teaching-and-learning-history-with-technology?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1#5.1), or learning by messing about. Rob MacDougall, of the University of Western Ontario, calls this ['the action figure curriculum'](http://www.robmacdougall.org/blog/2010/05/the-action-figure-curriculum/). I think it's time we did more of this.
