# Workshop TOC
Start by reading the [Introduction](introduction.md); then try using [Twine to prototype your ideas](prototyping-with-twine.md). With a prototype in hand, you'll know which of the tutorials below will best serve your interests. You can also try playing with a cardboard-AR experience I built called '[the diary in the attic](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/07/16/the-diary-in-the-attic/)' (android only, sorry).

### Main Tutorials
1 [Build an AR app](Build an AR app.md) (hard)(couple hours)

2 [Hacking Twine to Make a Location-Based Game](Hacking Twine to make a location-based game.md) (intermediate)(couple hours)

3 [Building 3d models using 123d catch](Building 3d models using 123d catch.md) (easy)(quick)

### Supplementary Tutorials

4 [Simple Geolocation with Mixare](simple-geolocation.md) (easy)(quick)

5 [Stereoscopic AR, or, Cardboard!](stereoscopic-ar.md) (intermediate)(need to complete tutorial 1 first)

6 [Docker, VSFM, & Command Line 3d Photogrammetry](3d model building with VSFM on the command line.md) (hard)(initial run can take quite some time)

-----
My intention in this workshop is to show you enough of the nuts-and-bolts so that you can build or remix into your own archaeological application or use. 

Feel free to fork this repo. If you run into trouble, if something is unclear or doesn't work, please leave a note under [issues](issues).

I look forward to seeing what you get up to!

I've advocated elsewhere that we should be playful with our digital tools; that game design principles should inform our use of digital tech; that games as a form of simulation can be used to advance archaeological arguments that emerge through play. Now that you've engaged with some of this, why not make a full-on archaeological video game? Here are some more tutorials to get you going. 

If you've already got GIS data [here's how to get your GIS data into Unity3d](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/06/08/importing-gis-data-into-unity/)(scroll to the update at bottom). You'll need [Microdem](http://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/website/microdem/microdem.htm) (which can also be run on Mac using [Winebottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/) or similar).

If you've got a scanned historical map without digital elevation data, [try this workflow instead](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/06/09/historical-maps-into-unity3d/). You'll need Microdem.

And if you'd rather not futz with Unity3d, you can put your topography into Minecraft instead [with this workflow](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2014/09/30/historical-maps-topography-into-minecraft-qgis/). Minecraft might be the best option, really, since 'digging' and the concept of stratigraphy is built deliberately into the code. You can even [mount your own expedition](http://electricarchaeology.ca/?s=minecraft+expedition).

Finally, a [recent-ish podcast episode of Spark, from the CBC, on Augmented Reality](http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/Spark/ID/2282507979/), if you'd like to listen to a variety of folks talking about AR & society in general.
