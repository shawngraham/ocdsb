# Writing History Through Video Games

You've played lots of games - board games, video games, card games. You've been to a living history museum and seen people dress up to play at the past. But have you ever considered what *writing* history *via* a game entails?

In this exercise, we will workshop how you might use the freely available gaming engine called [*Twine*](http://twinery.org) towards having your students write engaging piecees of **interactive historical (non/)fiction**. 


## Things you need to know and do, first

1. What is 'interactive fiction'? I've often felt that graphics get in the way. When we focus on graphics, we end up concentrating on what I call the tent-peg effect: we spend so much energy on the *look* of the game that we forget about the *experience*. Interactive fiction is a genre where the power of the computer is put towards crafting powerful stories where what you do as the player is a crucial element. I want you to stop everything and play [Beneath Floes](http://www.bravemule.com/storage/beneath-floes/beneathfloes.html).  Keep a piece of paper handy, or have your partner keep notes. What surprises you? What upsets you? How does this game make you feel? Who is the protagonist? What does 'history' look like in this game?

2. This brings me to my second point. Beneath Floes puts you in a very different space than what you are accustomed to playing, I'd wager. Many (if not most) of the AAA titles engage in a very specific kind of fantasy, where the player-protagonist has a great deal of power to effect change. Worlds hang in the balance almost every time. If we're going to write history via a video game, we need to think about what history is *for*.  What is history supposed to do? What are the *kinds* of history that fit well with how I've characterized the AAA titles - and what kinds would better map onto *Beneath Floes*? 

## Agency & Causality in the Past

One of the most powerful things that video games can achieve is to put ourselves in someone else's shoes. When we play games, it's not 'my character did that' - it's, '_I_ did that!'. Fostering [historical empathy](http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/graham/) is a powerful use-case for games. Understanding that _things could've turned out different_, understanding the _constraints_ that people had to operate in, is similarly powerful for guarding against a whig-type understanding of history. Similarly, the things that game players do - try things out, figure out why things work the way they do, and then try something else - are very similar to the patterns of historical thought that figures like [Peter Seixas](http://historicalthinking.ca/peter-seixas) and [Kevin Kee et al](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/can/summary/v090/90.2.kee.html) argue are the hallmarks of sophisticated understandings of the past. 

## Bringing this into the Classroom

Take this fantastic resource from the 'Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History' website: [http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/angelique/accueil/indexen.html]([http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/angelique/accueil/indexen.html). How would you get your students to explore and understand the 'why' of what Angelique may or may not have done?

+ take some time to explore that website. Concentrate on a single episode in the materials that strikes you as puzzling.
+ sketch out how you would approach this problem if you were writing an essay
+ now sketch out how this problem would look like if you were _experiencing_ these issues from a first-person perspective.
+ what is the key 'mechanic' at play for making your argument in each mode of expression?

### Now let's build!

Go to [Twine](http://twinery.org/2/#stories) - you can install it on your machine or run it in your browser. Either way is fine.

Double-click on the passage. Begin writing text to describe your ideal user's first interaction with your application. You use double `[[` and `]]` to mark text that describes some kind of choice. For instance,

`>` `The cows are in the field. Do you try to [[tip them over]]?`

This will generate a new passage called `tip them over`, and make a line tying the passages together. When you're ready, hit the up-arrow at the bottom left of the interface to 'publish to file'. This will generate a single webpage with your complete mock up as html.

When you are ready, we can share these files and try playing each other's experience.

Twine is very elastic; it can be used for very powerful work indeed - see Tara Copplestone's [Buried](http://taracopplestone.co.uk/buried.html) for instance. Why 'Buried' works is that Tara made the interaction reflect the theme of the work; it is art. The *rules* of interaction in digital media - not the graphics, not the pretty visuals, but the actual mechanics of how we react to the machine - are powerful forms of rhetoric that we're not in the habit of interrogating. Think of what Powerpoint has done to the lecture, this thing that encodes the rules of the business meeting. For my money, the digital media are at their best when their procedures, their rules, act _in harmony_ with the subject matter to create the argument you want your user to experience as an emergent phenomena.
